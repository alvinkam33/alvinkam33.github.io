# alvinkam.33.github.io (Personal Website)

My personal website, built using JavaScript (React.js), HTML and CSS. Features an "About Me", "Experience" and "Projects" section.

The majority of elements are styled on my own, with some components taken from Semantic UI: https://semantic-ui.com/.

The latest deployment of the website can be found at https://alvinkam.com/.
